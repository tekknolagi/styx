Styx is a programming language and its compiler.

The language has mostly a C syntax and a simple LL(1) grammar.
Its grammar is formally designed with a PEG and then the parser is written in D.
A particular focus is put on testing, using D features such as in code unit tests or code instrumentation for coverage.
