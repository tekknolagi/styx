### YATOL 

[![CI Status](https://travis-ci.org/BBasile/yatol.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/BBasile/yatol)

YATOL is _Yet Another TOy Langage_, a programming language and its compiler.
Its grammar is formally designed with a PEG and then fully written in D.

A short term goal is transpilation (v0.0.1) without (or with few, depending on the target compiler) semantic processing.
